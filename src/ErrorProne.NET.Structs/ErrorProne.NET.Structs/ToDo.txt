- Do not warn when readonly struct is passed by value into constructor. Done
- Make 'use 'in'-modifier an informational message instead of a warning. 

- Do not warn on readonly struct passed by in if a method is overriden or implements an interface. Done
- Do not warn if 'non-readonly friendly struct' is passed by 'in' in the same struct. Done

- Warn if readonly struct is passed by ref
- Analyze ref readonly locals
- Show all hidden copies for structs (info message? Would be good to turn this diagnostics on and off).
- Large struct used in many methods? Stateful analysis is required.
- Equals and gethashcode are asymmetrical (different props/fields are used). (not sure about that)

Known limitations
- No analysis of local methods. No clue how to analyse it.
- Generic instantiations are not analyzed: public void Foo<T>(in T t) {} Foo<NonReadOnly>(); <-- no warning now.
