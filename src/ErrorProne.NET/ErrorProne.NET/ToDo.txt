## Expression simplifier
Something that will simplify expressions at compile time will greatly simplify implementaiton!

For instance: string.Format(Format, GetStableFunction()); will be easily analyzed to
string.Format("{0}{1}", 1); if Format is a const and GetStableFunction() is a constant function!
(OK, function simplification is a next step, but for many cases it would be very helpful!)

if (foo);

if (foo)
  s1;
  s2;

Regex validity

Switch completeness (if default throws invalid operation or has Debug/Contract.assert)

Disable (remove) assignment-free object construction (could be if type is pure!!!)
Enable for structs (default ctors on structs!!)

Make swallowed exceptions just an info message (this is not even a warning!)

Make rule that will warn if ex.Message was used in catch(Exception)

Enumerable.Range is working, but Directory.CreateInstance also considered pure! Add checks to cover only immutable/pure type factories.

Add support for Diagnostic.Create for formatting string!

Additional rule:
 - Not call default ctor on struct (one example: immutable array). Add attribute to check!
